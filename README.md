#### Goal

Create an Ab Wheel that will have an assisted functionality. The user will roll forward extending the arms and body outward on their knees or in a plank position. Once they have reached maximum extension, they will roll back up to their initial position by pressing a button that will cause the wheel to rotate in the direction that is towards their body. This will allow beginner or out of shape users to build their core muscles. Once a user has achieved an optimal core strength, they can use the Ab Wheel manually.

#### Objectives

1. Computing specs for motor that can handle a load that is dependent on the weight of a user
2. Creating a circuit for the PIC32MX250F128B 
3. Designing PCB board from circuit 
4. Designing physical ab wheel 

More objectives will be added
